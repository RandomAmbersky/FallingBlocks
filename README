This package contains the source code for the game 'Falling Blocks'.
This game is written in z80 assembly for the ZX Spectrum.

The code has been successfully assembled and tested on both ZX Spin and Pasmo.
Using Pasmo allows you to produce a TAP file which can be read by most Spectrum
emulators or can even be used to produce a WAV file or tape copy of the game.

There is a TAP file included in the package that can be used on an emulator,
including online Javascript emulators like  http://jsspeccy.zxdemo.org/

The game itself is based on the classic Tetris, but with a few twists on the 
game and some extra features that are not commonly available like ghost (where
you can see where your piece would go if you dropped it) and save (where you 
can swap a piece in play for later usage).

It is possible to define your own keys for use in the game, but the default 
keys are as follows:

O		-	move left
P		-	move right
Space	-	rotate piece
D 		-	Drop piece
G		-	enable/disable ghost mode
S		-	Swap/Save a piece for later usage

You are able to modify the behaviour of the 'Drop piece' key in the settings menu
off the main menu. The three possible options are

Full - Pressing the drop key will cause the piece to fall down the screen as far as 
possible
While Held - This will cause the piece to drop as long as the drop key is pressed 
(effectively works like a down key)
Mixture - If you quickly press/tap the drop key, the piece will fall down the screen
as far as possible, however holding the drop key will drop the piece as long as the 
drop key is pressed - therefore a mixture of 'Full' and 'While Held'
